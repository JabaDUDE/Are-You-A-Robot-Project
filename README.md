# Are-You-A-Robot-Project

**Version 1.0**


Part of a Udemy course called '30 HTML CSS & JavaScript projects in 30 Days for Beginnners' by Norbert B Menyhart. I wanted to practice practical application of javascript
and seeing how it would work from scratch.

## Concepts Practiced In This Project
- DOM Event Listeners
- Array Methods (forEach loops)
- Conditionals
- Math Objects
- Booleans
- Functions
- Variables (importance of LET and CONST)
- classList

## Things That Need To Be Improved

- The 'answer' is always the bottom right element and is never any other element so it's not really random.
- The responsiveness of the page could be expanded upon and improved!
